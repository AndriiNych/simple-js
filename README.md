# Some simple projects in JavaScript.

**General information:**

- All projects collected in this small portfolio were done as homework while
  learning JavaScript.
- Here are the most interesting, in my opinion, works that show some experience
  gained while learning JavaScript.
- The general interface was implemented in **React** using **MUI** components.
- Local storage is used to store the dark/light theme.
- A minimal "styling function" was implemented to standardize project
  descriptions.
- **Tailwind** is used for styling.

**Project description:**

- Projects are implemented in pure **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS**.
- **SASS** preprocessor is used for **CSS**.
- To work with the API, we use: **fetch** and **axios**.
- Libraries are used to work with images: **basiclightbox** and
  **simplelightbox**.
- **Flatpickr** is used to work with the date.
- Messages are displayed thanks to the **notiflix** library.
- To eliminate unnecessary triggering when working with scrolls and input
  fields, the **throttle** and **debounce** functions are used from **lodash**.
- The video player is implemented on **@vimeo/player**.
- The visual part of the projects (HTML structure) was optimized in the react
  components to simplify the component itself and reduce the amount of HTML in
  it.
- Therefore, it may differ slightly from the source code. Minimal changes were
  made to the JavaScript code of the projects.
- Some functions and methods were combined into a start function, which was
  exported from the js file to the react component in order to launch the
  project.
